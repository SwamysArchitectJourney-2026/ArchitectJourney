## 📁 Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-materials/` (git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Permanent staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into ArchitectJourney educational content.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-materials/` folder
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews ALL files, identifies unique content, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to `Reference/` or `Learning/`
4. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important**: 
- Files in `source-materials/` are **NOT required to be compliant** - they are raw source materials
- The `source-materials/` folder itself is **permanent** - it's a staging area for ongoing migrations
- After migration, **keep source files** in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually

### Learning Paths Structure

**Important**: `Learning/` folders are created **as needed** when learning content is ready to be added. Empty folders are acceptable and expected.

**Policy**:
- ✅ Create `Learning/` folder structure when you have content ready to add
- ✅ Empty folders are acceptable - they indicate planned content
- ✅ Do not create empty folder hierarchies in advance
- ✅ Add content following Educational Content Rules when ready
- ✅ Create folders progressively as learning progresses

**Current Status**: `Learning/01_Core-Architecture-Path/` and `Learning/02_Lead-Architect-Path/` exist but are empty, which is acceptable per this policy.
