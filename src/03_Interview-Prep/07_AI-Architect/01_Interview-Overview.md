# AI + .NET Architect Interview Overview

**Interview Focus**: Azure AI + .NET Architect with Kubernetes positions require deep expertise in:

- Cloud-native .NET microservices architecture
- Azure AI services (OpenAI, Machine Learning, Cognitive Services)
- Kubernetes (AKS) for container orchestration
- Scalable, secure, enterprise-grade solutions

## Your 2-Minute Self-Introduction

**Memorize this introduction** for confident delivery:

> "I am a .NET Architect with strong experience in building scalable, cloud-native solutions using Azure, Kubernetes, and Azure AI.
> Recently, I've been architecting LLM-powered systems—combining Azure OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning, and containerized inference services running on AKS.
> I focus heavily on scalability, security, cost optimization, and building production-grade architectures that support enterprise-grade workloads.
> My strengths are in designing distributed systems, choosing the right Azure services, establishing DevOps/MLOps pipelines, and ensuring both performance and governance.
> I'm here today to walk you through how I design a scalable Azure AI solution on AKS, and how I would solve similar architecture challenges in your environment."

**Why this works:**

- Hits all expected keywords (Azure, Kubernetes, AI, .NET)
- Shows modern, relevant experience
- Demonstrates breadth (architecture, security, cost, operations)
- Sets up for technical deep-dives

## Interview Structure Expectations

**Typical interview flow:**

1. **Self-introduction** (2 minutes)
2. **Architecture whiteboarding** (20-30 minutes)
   - Draw scalable enterprise solutions
   - Explain trade-offs and design decisions
   - Discuss scalability, security, observability
3. **Technical questions** (15-20 minutes)
   - Azure AI service selection
   - AKS configuration and best practices
   - .NET microservices patterns
4. **Behavioral questions** (10-15 minutes)
   - STAR method responses
   - Leadership and problem-solving examples

## Key Areas to Master

**Priority order for preparation:**

1. **Azure AI landscape** - When to use Azure OpenAI vs Azure Machine Learning vs Cognitive Services
2. **AKS fundamentals** - GPU node pools, scheduling, autoscaling
3. **Model serving & MLOps** - KServe, Seldon, deployment patterns
4. **Scaling strategies** - HPA, KEDA, cluster autoscaler
5. **Security & governance** - Managed identity, Key Vault, Private Link
6. **Observability** - App Insights, Prometheus, Grafana
7. **Cost optimization** - GPU vs CPU, spot instances, right-sizing

## What Interviewers Look For

**Technical depth:**

- Can you design scalable architectures?
- Do you understand Azure AI service trade-offs?
- Can you configure AKS for AI workloads?

**Communication:**

- Can you explain complex systems clearly?
- Do you ask clarifying questions?
- Can you whiteboard effectively?

**Problem-solving:**

- Can you handle constraints (cost, latency, security)?
- Do you consider non-functional requirements?
- Can you justify design decisions?

## Next Steps

1. Review the **Study Roadmap** (`./02_Study-Roadmap.md`) for prioritized learning
2. Study **Architecture Patterns** (`./03_Architecture-Patterns-Part1-A.md`) for design patterns
3. Practice **Whiteboard Scenarios** (`./05_Whiteboard-Scenarios-Part1-A.md`) for hands-on practice
4. Memorize **Interview Questions** (`./04_Interview-Questions-Part1-A.md`) for Q&A prep
