# Self-Introduction & Preparation Phases

## 🎤 Your 2-Minute Self-Introduction

**Memorize this introduction** for confident delivery:

> "I am a DevOps & Azure Cloud Architect with extensive experience designing and implementing scalable cloud infrastructure on Azure. I specialize in building enterprise-grade solutions using AKS, implementing MLOps pipelines, and automating infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code.
>
> My expertise includes architecting multi-product cloud foundations that support rapid scaling, designing secure and cost-optimized infrastructure, and establishing DevOps practices that enable continuous delivery across development, UAT, and production environments.
>
> I'm particularly strong in Kubernetes orchestration, cloud migration strategies, and building MLOps foundations that support machine learning workloads at scale. I focus on creating infrastructure that is not just functional, but also maintainable, secure, and aligned with business objectives.
>
> I'm excited to discuss how I can help build and scale your cloud, AKS, and MLOps foundation across all product lines."

**Why this works**:
- Hits expected keywords (Azure, AKS, MLOps, DevOps, infrastructure)
- Shows enterprise-scale experience
- Demonstrates breadth (infrastructure, automation, ML, security)
- Aligns with role requirements
