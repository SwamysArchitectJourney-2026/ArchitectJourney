# TPM Interview Cheatsheet

**High-impact, memorizable quick reference** for your interview this week. Use this for quick recall during the interview — 1–2 minutes per subject.

---

## 1) Opening Elevator (30–60s)

"I'm Swamy — a software architect turned Technical Project Manager with 20+ years in .NET and cloud-native projects. I lead cross-functional teams end-to-end: architecture, Agile delivery, CI/CD, and operations. I focus on measurable delivery — velocity, cycle time, and customer outcomes — while keeping teams productive and motivated."

---

## 2) Core Pillars to Emphasize (repeat throughout answers)

* Delivery ownership (SDLC + Agile)
* Technical credibility (code reviews, architecture)
* DevOps & automation (CI/CD pipelines)
* Observability & SRE mindset (alerts, dashboards)
* Stakeholder communication (data-driven updates)

---

## 3) Quick SDLC Sprint Answer (ready script)

"Run sprint planning with PO to set sprint goal → estimate via planning poker → break stories into tasks → daily standups to remove blockers → mid-sprint check for scope drift → demo + retrospective. Use velocity + capacity to commit and enforce DoD."

---

## 4) System Design Quick Structure (use this every time)

1. Clarify requirements & SLAs
2. Data model (owner & consistency)
3. High-level components & flow
4. Scaling & resilience strategies
5. Security & compliance
6. Testing & rollout plan
7. Risks & mitigations
8. Metrics to monitor

---

## 5) Risk Handling Script (for many scenarios)

"Identify → quantify → mitigate → monitor. If risk materializes: escalate with impact, propose 2 options (quick mitigation + long-term fix), execute and follow-up with RCA."

---

## 6) Common Patterns to Name-Drop (sound knowledgeable)

* Saga, Circuit Breaker, CQRS, API Gateway, Event-Driven, Trunk-based development, Canary/Blue-Green, Contract Testing, Observability (traces/metrics/logs).

---

## 7) Quick Answers to Heavy-Hitters

* **Tech debt:** "Allocate 10–20% capacity; prioritize by risk and ROI."
* **Missed deadline:** "Re-baseline with PO, present scoped options (reduce scope / add resources / move deadline) and risks."
* **Production outage:** "War room, rollback if needed, triage, RCA within 24–48 hrs, preventive action."

---

## 8) One-Liners for Leadership Questions

* **Leading without authority:** "Build trust, provide data, align incentives, create quick wins."
* **Handling senior dev:** "Acknowledge expertise, use time-boxed debates, escalate if no resolution."

---

## 9) STAR Examples to Memorise (pick 3)

Prepare 3 short STAR stories: (1) Rapid delivery under pressure, (2) Resolved cross-team dependency, (3) Handled a production outage. Keep each to ~60–90 seconds:

* Situation → Task → Action (specific steps, people, tools) → Result (metrics/outcome).

---

## 10) Executive 60-Second Status Template (for CEO)

* "Project X — 65% complete. On track for [date] with two medium risks (dependency A, testing capacity). Mitigation: add integration window next sprint and automation to reduce testing time. Confidence: Amber (70%)."

---

## 11) Quick Metrics to Call Out in Answers

* Velocity, Cycle time, Lead time, Deployment frequency, MTTR, Defect escape rate, Payment success rate (for payments), Orders/sec (for e-commerce).

---

## 12) Closing Line (end interview)

"I'm excited by this role because it combines my engineering depth with delivery leadership. I can quickly contribute to architecture decisions, improve delivery pipelines, and drive measurable improvements in time-to-market and reliability."

---

## Final Tips — Practice & Delivery

* **Speak structured:** Use the System Design structure for every design question.
* **Use numbers:** velocity, % improvement, latency ms, throughput — makes you credible.
* **When unsure:** clarify requirements briefly, state assumptions explicitly, then proceed.
* **Keep answers stakeholder-focused:** how does the design reduce risk/cost/time-to-market?
