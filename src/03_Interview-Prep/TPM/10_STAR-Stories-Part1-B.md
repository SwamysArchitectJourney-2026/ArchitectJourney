**Theme:** Leadership, conflict resolution, communication, stakeholder alignment  
**Use For:** "Tell me about a conflict you resolved." / "How do you manage scope vs deadlines?"

### **S — Situation**

Product wanted to release a new customer analytics dashboard in **8 weeks**. Engineering estimated **14 weeks** due to complex backend changes. This caused tension and disagreements, slowing down progress.

### **T — Task**

As TPM, I had to **align both teams**, find a feasible plan, remove tension, and ensure on-time delivery.

### **A — Action**

1. **Facilitated a structured discussion**
   * Time-boxed a 2-hour workshop.
   * Asked each side to present evidence: effort estimates, dependencies, business priorities.

2. **Decomposed work**
   * Broke the feature into 4 slices:
     * Slice 1: Basic metrics
     * Slice 2: Real-time graphs
     * Slice 3: User segmentation
     * Slice 4: Export & advanced filters

3. **Negotiated scope**
   * Delivered Slice 1 & 2 in **8 weeks** (meeting Product's deadline).
   * Moved Slice 3 & 4 to Phase 2 (Sprint 4–6).

4. **Created alignment with data**
   * Used story points, velocity charts, and dependency board to show realistic timelines.
   * Provided a burn-up chart showing both teams' commitments.

5. **Communication plan**
   * Weekly checkpoints with Product.
   * Bi-weekly demos to maintain trust.

### **R — Result**

* Delivered **Phase 1 on time** with zero critical bugs.
* Stakeholder confidence increased; team morale improved.
* Phase 2 delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule due to reduced friction.
* This structured approach became the **standard conflict-resolution method** for the org.

## ⭐ STAR STORY 4 — Team Performance Issue (Low morale + missed targets)

**Theme:** Team management, performance improvement, process optimization  
**Use For:** "How do you handle underperforming teams?" / "Describe a time you improved team productivity."

### **S — Situation**

A team of 8 developers repeatedly missed sprint commitments, morale was low, and people were overworked. Velocity dropped by **35%**.

### **T — Task**

Restore team performance, improve predictability, and bring back healthy delivery cadence.

### **A — Action**

1. Conducted one-on-one check-ins → root causes: unclear requirements, hidden work, and lack of automation.
2. Introduced **Definition of Ready** so team only picked clear stories.
3. Added automation for repetitive tasks (build, test, deployment).
4. Improved planning: used capacity-based sprint planning instead of gut-feel planning.
5. Established a "no-meeting focus window" for deep work every morning.

### **R — Result**

* Velocity increased by **45%** within 3 sprints.
* Sprint predictability improved from **50% → 90%**.
* Team morale visibly improved, fewer weekend work hours.
* Team went on to deliver two major releases ahead of schedule.
