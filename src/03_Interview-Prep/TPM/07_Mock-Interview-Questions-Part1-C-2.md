How do you ensure architecture consistency?Architecture review board, ADR (architecture decision record), coding standards.---### 11. How do you build a release plan?Define release cycles → entry/exit criteria → regression testing → deployment window → rollback plan.---### 12. How do you manage risks?Identify → assess → mitigate → track → escalate high-impact risks.---### 13. How do you handle performance bottlenecks?Profiling → DB optimization → caching → async processing → load testing.---### 14. How do you ensure security?OWASP top 10, static analysis, API authentication, secrets management.---### 15. How do you handle tech debt?Allocate 10–20% sprint capacity + prioritize based on impact.---### 16. Explain blue-green deployment.Two identical environments → switch traffic → zero downtime.---### 17. Explain canary release.Release to small % users → monitor → expand gradually.---### 18. How do you manage remote teams?Clear communication rules + overlap hours + tooling + written documentation.---### 19. How do you track test coverage?Using SonarQube, unit test reports, code coverage dashboards.---### 20. How do you manage architectural changes?RFC document → review → impact analysis → phased rollout.---## 🔗 Related Documents- [Part 1-A: Basic Level](./07_Mock-Interview-Questions-Part1-A.md) - Basic level questions- [Part 1-B: Intermediate Level](./07_Mock-Interview-Questions-Part1-B.md) - Intermediate level questions- [Part 1-D: Expert Level](./07_Mock-Interview-Questions-Part1-D.md) - Expert level questions- [Model Answers](./03_Model-Answers.md) - Additional model answers
