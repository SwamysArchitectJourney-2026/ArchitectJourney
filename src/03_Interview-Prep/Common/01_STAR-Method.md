## ✅ Example: STAR Answer

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you handled a difficult stakeholder."

**Answer using STAR:**

**Situation:**
"During a critical project, we had a stakeholder who was pushing for an unrealistic deadline that would compromise code quality."

**Task:**
"As the TPM, I needed to balance the stakeholder's expectations with the team's capacity while maintaining quality standards."

**Action:**
"I scheduled a meeting with the stakeholder and prepared data showing our historical velocity, current sprint capacity, and the risks of rushing. I proposed a phased delivery approach where we could deliver core features in the requested timeframe and additional features in a follow-up release. I also involved the technical lead to explain the technical implications."

**Result:**
"The stakeholder agreed to the phased approach. We delivered the core features on time with high quality, and the additional features were delivered two weeks later. This approach became a standard practice for managing similar situations, and the stakeholder appreciated the data-driven communication."
