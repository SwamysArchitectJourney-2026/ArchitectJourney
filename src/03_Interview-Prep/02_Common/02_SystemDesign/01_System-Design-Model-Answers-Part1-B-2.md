**APIs*** `GET /availability?users=[ids]&range=`* `POST /meetings {organizer, attendees, slot}`**Scaling*** Cache availability; prefetch for frequent users; use background jobs for token refresh.**Edge cases*** Conflicting concurrent bookings → optimistic concurrency plus retry/resolution UI.**Security*** OAuth token security, scope-limited tokens, least privilege.**TPM delivery*** Integrations are biggest risk: schedule milestones for each connector (Google, MS Graph).**Metrics*** Booking success rate, calendar sync failure rate, time to sync.---## 5) Distributed Payment Processing System (high reliability)**Requirements*** F: Accept payments, support multiple gateways, reconciliation, refunds, refunds idempotency, settlement.* NF: PCI scope minimization, high reliability, audit, eventual consistency for settlements.**Architecture*** Client → Order Service → Payment Orchestrator → Gateway Adapters (Stripe/PayPal/Bank) → Clearing/Settlement Service → Accounting DB.* Use asynchronous workflows via message broker; state machine (workflow engine) for payment lifecycle.**Core components*** Payment Orchestrator: centralizes flows, retries, timeouts, compensations.* Gateway Adapters: encapsulate provider specifics.* Reconciliation Service: matches settlement files from banks, marks completed.* Ledger/Accounting: immutable ledger for audit.**Design patterns*** Saga pattern for multi-step payments (authorize → capture → settle) with compensating actions (refund) if partially failed.* Idempotency keys across payment operations.**APIs*** `POST /payments {orderId, amount, method, idempotencyKey}`* `POST /payments/{id}/refund {amount, reason}`**Security & Compliance*** Use tokenization; never store card numbers; redirect to gateway-hosted pages or use client-side tokenization.* PCI-DSS scope reduction via hosted fields.**Resilience*** Retry logic with exponential backoff; fallback gateways; circuit breakers.**Testing & Rollout*** Mock payment provider for end-to-end test; run test settlement cycles; reconcile with test banks.**TPM delivery*** Large cross-functional effort: payments team, accounting, legal/compliance; start with single gateway, then add others.**Risks*** Settlement mismatches → robust reconciliation and alerts.* Chargebacks/fraud → fraud detection pipeline.**Metrics*** Payment success rate, average payment latency, reconciliation lag, failed refunds.---## 🔗 Related Documents- [Part 1-A: Ticket Booking and URL Shortener](./01_System-Design-Model-Answers-Part1-A-1.md) - Scenarios 1-2- [Part 1-C: Event-Driven Systems, Analytics, CI/CD](./01_System-Design-Model-Answers-Part1-C-1.md) - Scenarios 6-8- [Part 1-D: Migration and Multi-Region](./01_System-Design-Model-Answers-Part1-D.md) - Scenarios 9-10- [System Design Questions](../../04_TPM/04_System-Design-Questions-Part1-A-1.md) - TPM-focused system design questions
