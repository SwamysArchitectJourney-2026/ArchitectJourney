## 🔄 The Unified Journey: Two Complementary Tracks

ArchitectJourney offers **two powerful learning tracks** that can be pursued independently or combined into a **unified mastery progression**:

### **Track 1: Core Architecture Path** (Skill-Building)

**9 Levels** — From developer foundations to architectural mastery  
**Focus**: Technical capabilities, system design, and architectural thinking  
**Duration**: 36-48 months  
**Outcome**: Solutions Architect, Technical Lead, Senior Engineer

### **Track 2: Lead Architect Path** (Leadership-Building)

**9 Phases** — From architectural thinking to strategic leadership  
**Focus**: Decision frameworks, organizational transformation, and strategic vision  
**Duration**: 9-12 months (intensive program for experienced architects)  
**Outcome**: Lead Architect, Principal Architect, Chief Architect, VP Technology

### **The Unified Progression** (Complete Mastery)

By combining both tracks, you can progress from **junior developer to strategic technology leader** in a single, continuous journey:

```

**Total Duration**: 42-60 months (3.5-5 years)

### **How the Tracks Integrate**

| Stage | Core Path (Levels) | Lead Path (Phases) | Combined Focus |

```

### 🎯 Strategic Architecture

The repository uses a **dual-folder approach** at the root level:

- **`01_Reference/`** — Static knowledge library for immediate lookup without dependencies
- **`02_Learning/`** — Sequential, scaffolded learning paths with prerequisites and progressive skill-building
- **`03_Interview-Prep/`** — Time-bound interview preparation materials for architecture and technical roles

This design serves different learning modalities and supports professionals at all career stages. The structure will be implemented incrementally as content is developed.

### 📊 Current Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Repository Setup** | ✅ Complete | GitHub organization created, repository structure established |
| **Configuration Files** | ✅ Complete | Cursor rules, Copilot instructions, and project guidelines |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Active | GitHub organization strategy and workspace review documents |
| **01_Reference/** | 🏗️ Planned | Static knowledge library - to be created as content is developed |
| **02_Learning/** | 🏗️ Planned | Progressive learning paths - to be created as content is developed |
| **03_Interview-Prep/** | 🏗️ Planned | Interview preparation materials - to be created as content is developed |
